Mongoose is a library (ODM) that makes working with MongoDB easier and more structured in Node.js applications.

it Prodives:
-a schema-based structure
-easy CRUD operations`
-validation
-relationships
-middleware (hooks)

Why do we need Mongoose?
MongoDB is schema-less, meaning:
-you can store anything
-no fixed structure
-easy to make mistakes

Mongoose adds:
-structure
-rules
-validation

->Without Mongoose
    db.users.insertOne({ name: "Vraj", age: "twenty" });

    --Age should be number, but MongoDB allows it.

->With Mongoose
    const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
        name: String,
        age: Number
    });

    --"twenty" will be rejected.
