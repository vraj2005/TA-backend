JWT is a token-based authentication mechanism used to securely transmit user information between client and server.

3 parts
HEADER-token type and algorithum
PAYLOAD-user information(user ID, role, etc)
SIGNATURE-protects the token from being changed

How does JWT work?

1. The user logs in using a username and password. The server checks the credentials.
2. The server creates a JWT with your user ID or username and signs it.
3. On the frontend, the JWT is stored in localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies.
4. Whenever you send a request to the backend, this JWT is sent along with it to verify your identity.
5. If the token is valid, access is granted. If not, access is denied.

Developers like JWT because it is:

1. Stateless
2. Lightweight
3. Widely supported
4. Secure
5. Suitable for different architectures

Fact:
JWT is encoded, not encrypted. So never store sensitive information inside a JWT while building applications.

Flow
Client → Login → Server
Server → JWT Token → Client
Client → Request + Token → Server
Server → Verify Token → Allow / Deny

npm install jsonwebtoken

How it works in Ecommerce 

User Login
Server verifies user
JWT Token generated
Token stored in client
Token sent with every request
Server verifies token
Allow access (cart, orders, payment)
