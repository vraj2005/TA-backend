1. Intercepting Route in Next.js

Definition:-
An Intercepting Route allows you to show another route’s content inside the current page UI
(without fully navigating away).

-Mostly used to open modals, popups, or overlays
-Background page remains visible

Simple Meaning: Open a page on top of another page instead of replacing it.


->Real-World Example: Instagram / Facebook

When you click a post from the feed:
* It opens as a modal popup
* Feed remains in background
* URL changes
* Refreshing the page → opens full page post

This is exactly Intercepting Route behavior.


Folder Idea (Concept)

feed page → background
photo page → full page
modal photo → intercepted inside feed


Why we use Intercepting Routes

-Show modal without losing context
-Better user experience
-Faster navigation
-Keep background state (scroll position, etc.)

One-line Exam Answer (Intercepting Route)

> Intercepting routes in Next.js allow displaying a route’s content inside another route (such as a modal) without leaving the current page.

2. Route Handler in Next.js

Definition:-A Route Handler is used to "create backend API endpoints" inside a Next.js application.

It works like:

-Express.js routes
-REST API endpoints
-Server-side logic handler

Where it exists:-
app/api/hello/route.ts


Supports HTTP methods:

* `GET`
* `POST`
* `PUT`
* `DELETE`

Real-World Example: E-commerce Website

When you:
* View products → **GET /api/products**
* Add product → **POST /api/products**
* Update product → **PUT /api/products**
* Delete product → **DELETE /api/products**

These APIs are created using Route Handlers.

Why Route Handlers are used

✔ Build backend inside Next.js
✔ Handle database operations
✔ Create REST APIs
✔ Process form submissions
✔ Authentication & data fetching

> A route handler in Next.js is used to create server-side API endpoints that handle HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

Difference Between Intercepting Route & Route Handler

| Feature   | Intercepting Route     | Route Handler        |
| --------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Purpose   | UI navigation behavior | Backend API logic    |
| Works on  | Pages & modals         | Server endpoints     |
| User sees | Modal / overlay        | JSON response        |
| Example   | Instagram post modal   | `/api/products` CRUD |
