1. Intercepting Route in Next.js

Definition:-
An Intercepting Route allows you to show another route’s content inside the current page UI(without fully navigating away).

-Mostly used to open modals, popups, or overlays
-Background page remains visible

Simple Meaning: Open a page on top of another page instead of replacing it.


->Real-World Example: Instagram / Facebook

When you click a post from the feed:
* It opens as a modal popup
* Feed remains in background
* URL changes
* Refreshing the page → opens full page post

This is exactly Intercepting Route behavior.


Folder Idea (Concept)

feed page → background
photo page → full page
modal photo → intercepted inside feed


Why we use Intercepting Routes

-Show modal without losing context
-Better user experience
-Faster navigation
-Keep background state (scroll position, etc.)

One-line Exam Answer (Intercepting Route)

> Intercepting routes in Next.js allow displaying a route’s content inside another route (such as a modal) without leaving the current page.


2. Route Handler in Next.js

Definition:-A Route Handler is used to "create backend API endpoints" inside a Next.js application.

It works like:

-Express.js routes
-REST API endpoints
-Server-side logic handler

Where it exists:-
app/api/hello/route.ts


Supports HTTP methods:

* `GET`
* `POST`
* `PUT`
* `DELETE`

Real-World Example: E-commerce Website

When you:
* View products → "GET /api/products"
* Add product → "POST /api/products"
* Update product → "PUT /api/products"
* Delete product → "DELETE /api/products"

These APIs are created using Route Handlers.

Why Route Handlers are used

✔ Build backend inside Next.js
✔ Handle database operations
✔ Create REST APIs
✔ Process form submissions
✔ Authentication & data fetching

One-line Exam Answer (Route Handler)

> A route handler in Next.js is used to create server-side API endpoints that handle HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

Difference Between Intercepting Route & Route Handler

| Feature   | Intercepting Route     | Route Handler        |
| --------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| Purpose   | UI navigation behavior | Backend API logic    |
| Works on  | Pages & modals         | Server endpoints     |
| User sees | Modal / overlay        | JSON response        |
| Example   | Instagram post modal   | `/api/products` CRUD |

1. Why do we create `@modal` folder?

In Next.js App Router:
@something is called a **Parallel Route Slot**.

So: we create
@modal
means:“Render this content in a separate UI slot (like a modal area).”

->Purpose of `@modal`

We create `@modal` to:
* Show **popup/modal UI**
* Keep **background page visible**
* Render **two routes at same time**
  * Background → feed
  * Overlay → modal photo

->Real-world example:Instagram feed

* Feed stays visible
* Clicking photo → opens **modal popup**
* URL changes
* Refresh → full photo page opens


One-line exam answer (for `@modal`)

> `@modal` is used as a parallel route slot to display intercepted content such as modals without leaving the current page.

2. Why do we write `( .. )photo` in intercepting route?

Meaning of `( .. )`

In Next.js intercepting routes:

(..) means: “Go **one level up** in routing and intercept that route.”

It is similar to:
../ in file paths.

So `( .. )photo` means:
Intercept the route from:
app/lab23/photo/[id]
and show it "inside modal of feed" instead of navigating fully.

Without `( .. )`

If you write normal folder:
@modal/photo/[id]
Then it becomes a **separate route**,
NOT an intercepted one ❌

So modal behavior **will not work**.

Real-world meaning

Think like:
* User is on **Feed page**
* Clicks **Photo**
* Instead of leaving feed:
  * We **intercept** `/photo/[id]`
  * Show it in **modal**

That interception is done by:(..)photo

One-line exam answer (for `( .. )photo`)
> `( .. )` is used to intercept a route from the parent level so that it can be rendered inside another route such as a modal.

| Symbol        | Meaning                     | Purpose                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `@modal`      | Parallel route slot         | Show modal/overlay UI     |
| `( .. )`      | Go one level up & intercept | Capture another route     |
| `( .. )photo` | Intercept `/photo` route    | Render photo inside modal |
