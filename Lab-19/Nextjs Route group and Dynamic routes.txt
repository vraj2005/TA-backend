1. What is a Route Group in Next.js?**

A Route Group is a folder wrapped in round brackets ( ) that is used to organize routes and 
apply layouts without affecting the URL.

--Route group folder name does NOT appear in the browser URL.

---

Why Route Groups are used

To organize large projects
To separate auth, admin, client areas
To apply different layouts
To keep URLs clean

**Example of Route Group**

Folder Structure
app/
 └── (auth)/
      └── login/
           └── page.tsx

export default function LoginPage() {
  return <h1>Login Page</h1>;
}

-----URL
/login

❌ NOT /auth/login
✔ Route group (auth) is ignored in URL

---
 **Route Group with Different Layouts**
Folder Structure

app/
 ├── (admin)/
 │     ├── layout.tsx
 │     └── dashboard/page.tsx
 │
 └── (client)/
       ├── layout.tsx
       └── profile/page.tsx

Each group has its "own layout", but URLs remain clean.

Real-World Example: E-Commerce Application
Folder Structure
app/
 ├── (auth)/
 │     ├── login/page.tsx
 │     └── register/page.tsx
 │
 ├── (admin)/
 │     ├── dashboard/page.tsx
 │     ├── products/page.tsx
 │     └── orders/page.tsx
 │
 ├── (client)/
 │     ├── home/page.tsx
 │     ├── product/[id]/page.tsx
 │     └── cart/page.tsx

2. What is a Dynamic Route in Next.js?

Dynamic Routeallows passing "parameters through the URL" using "square brackets `[ ]`".

These parameters can be accessed inside the page using `params`.

---

Why Dynamic Routes are used

* User profiles (`/user/101`)
* Product details (`/product/5`)
* Pagination (`/page/2`)
* Filtering (`/price/100/500`)

---

Example 1: Dynamic Route with `id`
Folder Structure

app/
 └── user/
      └── [id]/
           └── page.tsx

page.tsx
export default function UserPage
({ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  return <h1>User ID: {params.id}</h1>;
}

/user/101


Example 2: Dynamic Route with multiple parameters

Folder Structure

app/
 └── range/
      └── [start]/
           └── [end]/
                └── page.tsx


page.tsx
export default function RangePage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ start: string; end: string }>
}) {
  return (
    <h1>
      Start: {params.start}, End: {params.end}
    </h1>
  );
}

/range/10/50


> Dynamic routes in Next.js allow passing parameters through the URL using square brackets and accessing them via the params object.

Difference Between Route Group and Dynamic Route

| Feature        | Route Group        | Dynamic Route       |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Purpose        | Organize routes    | Pass URL parameters |
| Syntax         | `(group)`          | `[param]`           |
| Appears in URL | ❌ No              | ✅ Yes             |
| Used for       | Layout & structure | Data-driven pages   |


What is a Promise?

A Promise in JavaScript is an object that represents a value that will be available in the future, not immediately.
It is used for asynchronous operations

Some tasks do not finish instantly, for example:
Fetching data from server
Reading files
Database queries
API calls
Getting route params in modern Next.js

Real-life analogy
->Amazon order
You place order → you get a promise
Later → order delivered or failed
States:
Pending → Order processing
Fulfilled → Delivered
Rejected → Cancelled / failed
Same with Promise.

A Promise has 3 states:
State	Meaning
Pending:Operation is still running
Fulfilled:Operation completed successfully
Rejected:Operation failed


Why Promise is important in Next.js

In modern Next.js:
Data fetching
Route params
Headers
Cookies
Server actions
->All are async

params: Promise<{ id: string }>
const { id } = await params;
