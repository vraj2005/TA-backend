What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React-based full-stack web application framework created by Vercel.
It enhances React by providing a structured way to build:

Server-rendered applications
Static websites
Full-stack applications (frontend + backend)
SEO-friendly, scalable, and optimized web apps

Next.js adds powerful features that React alone does not provide, such as routing, server components, 
server-side rendering, API routes, and build-time optimizations.


1. Setup a Next.js Project Using npx create-next-app@latest (A)

To create a new Next.js project:
Run Command:-----npx create-next-app@latest

Answer Prompts (TypeScript, Tailwind, etc.)

Next.js automatically installs:

React
TypeScript (optional)
ESLint
SWC compiler
Project structure
App Router (app/ folder)
Once setup completes:

Start Development Server
npm run dev


Your Next.js app runs at:
👉 http://localhost:3000



2. Explore Default Project Structure (A)

After creating a project, the main structure looks like:
project-folder/
│
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── globals.css
│
├── public/
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
├── next.config.mjs
├── tsconfig.json
└── .gitignore


| File/Folder       | Purpose                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `app/`            | Routing system using the App Router |
| `page.tsx`        | Default home page                   |
| `layout.tsx`      | Common layout wrapper               |
| `globals.css`     | Global CSS file                     |
| `public/`         | Static assets                       |
| `next.config.mjs` | Framework configuration             |
| `package.json`    | Scripts + dependencies              |
| `tsconfig.json`   | TypeScript configuration            |


3. Modify page.tsx to Display "Hello World…" (A)

Inside app/page.tsx:
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <h1>Hello World from Next Application</h1>
  );
}


4. Detailed Note on Project Structure of a Next.js Application (B)


A Next.js application follows a well-organized project structure that helps developers manage pages, components, APIs, 
and configurations efficiently. The structure is designed to simplify routing, state management, styling, and server-side rendering.

1. app/ Directory (Main Routing System)

The app/ folder is the core of Next.js (version 13+), known as the App Router.
It enables:
File-based routing
Nested layouts
Server Components by default
Advanced rendering (SSR, SSG, ISR)

Main files inside the app folder:
a) page.tsx
Represents the content of a route.
Example:
app/about/page.tsx → URL: /about

b) layout.tsx
Defines a shared layout for all routes inside that folder

Includes navbar, footer, metadata, etc.

c) loading.tsx
Fallback UI shown while the page loads.

d) error.tsx
Used for error handling at route level.

e) template.tsx
For re-rendering layouts when needed.

f) Route Handlers (route.ts)
Used to create backend APIs inside the app router.
Works like Express:

export function GET() {}
export function POST() {}

2. public/ Directory

Contains static assets such as images, icons, and static files.

Examples:

favicon.ico
Images (/public/profile.png)
Robots.txt
Files inside public can be accessed directly by path without import.

3. styles/ or globals.css

The global CSS file loaded once throughout the application.
Located in:

app/globals.css
Contains base styles and resets.

4. components/ Directory (Optional)

Developers often create a components folder to store reusable UI elements:

components/
  Navbar.tsx
  Footer.tsx
  Button.tsx

These components are imported into pages or layouts.

5. lib/ Directory (Optional)

Stores helper functions, utilities, data fetching logic, and database connections.
Example:

lib/
  db.ts
  auth.ts
  fetcher.ts

6. next.config.mjs

Configuration file for customizing Next.js features.
Used for:

Enabling image domains
Custom headers
Redirects
Experimental features
Webpack configuration

7. package.json

Contains:

Dependencies
Scripts (dev, build, start)
Version information
Project metadata

8. tsconfig.json

TypeScript configuration file.
Defines:

Path aliases
Strict mode
Compiler rules
JSX environment

9. node_modules/ Directory

Contains all installed libraries and dependencies.

10. API Routes

Next.js supports backend creation in two ways:

a) App Router API
app/api/users/route.ts

b) Pages Router API (older method)
pages/api/users.js


These endpoints return JSON responses and behave like Express routes.
